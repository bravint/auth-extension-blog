# Commenting on Posts

- Build a route to add a comment to an existing post
- The route should accept an optional `parentId` field so comments can be a child of existing comments, allowing comments to have replies
- The route should respond with the complete comment data *and* the post data or parent comment data, depending on whether it's a reply to an existing comment
