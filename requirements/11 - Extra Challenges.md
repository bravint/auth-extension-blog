# Extra Challenges

1. Add the ability to filter getting all posts by whether they are published
2. Add the ability for users to "like" a post
    - This will require another model that links users to posts (a user can like many posts, and a post can be liked by many users)
    - Add the number of likes to every response containing post data
3. Build a route to get statistical data for a user, including:
    - How many posts they have that are published
    - How many posts they have that are unpublished
    - How many comments they have made
    - How many posts they have liked
