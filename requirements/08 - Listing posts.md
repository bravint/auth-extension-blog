# Listing posts

- Build a route to retrieve a list of posts
- The route should have the following optional filters available:
    - Limit the number of posts to get back in the response
    - Only get posts for a specific user by username or ID
    - Ability to order by most recent first or oldest first
- The response should contain the post details, its category and all of its comments
